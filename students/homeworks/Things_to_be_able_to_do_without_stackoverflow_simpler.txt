############# Plotting
Plotting:
make a plot of a s sinusoid with a range from -pi to pi					x=np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,100)
											y=np.sin(x)
											fig, axis = plt.subplots(1,1)
											axis.scatter(x,y)
											axis.plot(x,y)

x=np.arange(10) 	                                                                how to generate ordered integers from 0 to 10					    
x=np.random.uniform(2,5)                                                                how to generate single random number from the uniform distribution between 2 and 5  
x=np.random.uniform(2,5,100)                                                            how to generate 100 random numbers from the uniform distribution between 2 and 5    
x=np.random.normal(mu,sigma,1000)                                                       how to generate 100 random numbers from the normal distribution, given mu and sigma 


############## INTERPOLATION
what are the methods of interpolation							spline, hermite, Lagrange polynomial
how does spline work									piecewice interpolation for each pair (line or curve)... etc

############## DIFFERENTIATION 
what is the geometrical interpretation of derivative					slope
how to find derivative using Python							from scipy.misc import derivative
											derivative(y,x)
what scheme uses Python scipy.misc.derivative and why					central difference (error is smaller)


############### INTEGRATION
what is the geometrical interpretation of integration (simplified)			area under the curve
what are the schemes for the numerical integration					trapezoid, Simpson
when do we use scipy.quad and when np.trapz						first if we know the function, second if we know the data points
how can one estimate numerical integral using Monte Carlo Method			acceptance-rejection, mean value method
what are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo Method				slower and less precise for simple integrals (quad is better)
											but can be useful for highdimensional complex integrals

############### Differential equations
how does Euler method works:								estimates next point from the previous point and derivate at this point
how does Runge-Kutta works								similar to Euler method but the derivative is calculated with weighted functions
whats the difference between scipy.solve_ivp and scipy.solve_bvp			first solves Initial value problem, second boundary value problem 

############### Linear algebra
whats the difference between matrix and array						first one is 2D numbers second can be any dimension any values
What is the difference between M*M and M@M multiplication				first is element by element second is matrix multipliction (row x col)
whats the difference between Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition			
how can one calculate matrix to the power of 1000 more efficiently			using diagonalization method

############### Fitting
what does it mean least-squares method and how it works					minimizes sum of the squares of the residuals
what is the difference between interpolation and fitting				interpolation finds points between known points 
											fitting finds a function that fits the all the points at once
