############# Plotting
Plotting:
4. make a plot of a s sinusoid with a range from -pi to pi				x=np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,100)

7. x=np.linspace(0,np.pi,100)                                                           how to generate a numpy array from 0 to np.pi with 100 evenly spaced elements	    
8. x=np.random.uniform(2,5,100)                                                         how to generate 100 random numbers from the uniform distribution between 2 and 5    
9. x=np.random.normal(mu,sigma,1000)                                                    how to generate 100 random numbers from the normal distribution, given mu and sigma 


############## INTERPOLATION
10. what are the methods of interpolation						spline, hermite, Lagrange polynomial
11. how does spline work								piecewice interpolation for each pair (line or curve)... etc

############## DIFFERENTIATION 
12. what is the geometrical interpretation of derivative				slope
13. scipy.misc.derivative uses forward, backward or central derivative?			central difference (error is smaller)

############### INTEGRATION
14. what is the geometrical interpretation of integration (simplified)			area under the curve
15. what are two most commond methods (schemes) for the numerical integration		trapezoid, Simpson
16. when do we use scipy.quad and when np.trapz						first if we know the function, second if we know the data points
17. how can we estimate numerical integral using Monte Carlo Method			acceptance-rejection, mean value method
18. what are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo Method			slower and less precise for simple integrals (quad is better)
											but can be useful for highdimensional complex integrals

############### Differential equations
19. how does Euler method works:							estimates next point from the previous point and derivate at this point
20. how does Runge-Kutta works								similar to Euler method but the derivative is calculated with weighted functions
whats the difference between scipy.solve_ivp and scipy.solve_bvp			first solves Initial value problem, second boundary value problem 

############### Linear algebra
21. whats the difference between matrix and array					first one is 2D numbers second can be any dimension any values
22. What is the difference between M*M and M@M multiplication				first is element by element second is matrix multipliction (row x col)
23. how deoes LU decomposition work							it decomposes matrix by upper and lower matrix and solution can be obtain by backward/forward substitution			
24. how can one calculate matrix to the power of 1000 more efficiently			using diagonalization method

############### Fitting
25. what does it mean least-squares method and how it works				algorithm that minimizes sum of the squares of the residuals
26. what is the difference between interpolation and fitting				interpolation finds points between pair of two known points 
											fitting finds a function that fits all the points at once
############### Additional questions
27. let say A=np.array([1,2,3]), what is the difference between:			in the first case (shallow copy) if we modify A then B will also be modified, in the second case (deep copy) B will be independet from A from the moment of creation
    B=A
    B=A.copy()
28 what is the difference between numpy and scipy					numpy is "numerical python" particularmente util con general arrays
											scipy is "scientific python" particularmente util para otro parte de matematica, calculus, equacione diferenciales
											much bibliotecas existen en ambos: numpy/scipy por ejemplo np.sqrt() scipy.sqrt() etc...
29. what is the purpose of sequence:
    try:
    ...											Try to perform some operation (try:), but if any error happens then do (except:) 
    except:
    ...
30. which method is faster to multiply matrices:					loop is always slower tha build-in functions. Build-in functions are optimized

a) for i in range(n):							
    for j in range(m):
      for z in range(k):
        product[i, j] += matrix1[i, z] * matrix2[z, j]
	
b) product = np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)
