The answers can be just one sentence.

Example 1: x=np.random.randint(1,100,10) 				- generates 10 random integers between 1:100
Example 2: how does Euler methods works? (differential equations) 	- estimates next point from the previous point and derivate at this point 
Example 3: how does Runge-Kutta works? (differential equations) 	- similar to Euler method but the derivative is caluculated using more points
Example 4: how deoes LU decomposition work 				- decomposes matriz into lower and upper matrix and the does backward/forward substitution
Example 5: what is the difference between interpolation and fitting 	- interpolation we can use only when we want to estimate point between two points and we know that the two points do not carry error
								    	- fitting makes an adjust of a function to all the points
