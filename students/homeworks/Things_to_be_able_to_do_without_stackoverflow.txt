############# Plotting
Plotting:
how to import plotting library								import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
how to plot sinusoid with a range from -pi to pi					x=np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,100)
											y=np.sin(x)
											fig, axis = plt.subplots(1,1)
											axis.scatter(x,y)
											axis.plot(x,y)

how to plot a 10x10 array as an image							fig, axis = plt.subplots(1,1)
											axis.imshow(A)

											axis[1,0].imshow(np.random.rand(10,10))
											axis[1,1].imshow(np.random.rand(10,10))

how to the same plot in the loop							fig, axis = plt.subplots(2,2)
											xrange = np.arange(2)
											for i in xrange:
												for j in xrange:
													axis[i,j].imshow(A)

############## INTERPOLATION

what are the methods of interpolation							spline, hermite, Lagrange polynomial
which one is most common								spline
how does spline work									piecewice interpolation for each pair... etc

############## DIFFERENTIATION 
what is the geometrical interpretation of derivative					slope
how to find derivative using Python							from scipy.misc import derivative
											derivative(y,x)
what scheme uses Python scipy.misc.derivative and why					central difference (error is smaller)


############### INTEGRATION
what is the geometrical interpretation of integration (simplified)			area under the curve
what are the schemes for the numerical integration					trapezoid, Simpson
when do we use scipy.quad and when np.trapz						first if we know the function, second if we know the data points
how can one estimate numerical integral using Monte Carlo Method			acceptance-rejection, mean value method
what are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo Method				slower and less precise for simple integrals (quad is better)
											but can be useful for highdimensional complex integrals

############### Differential equations

############### Linear algebra

############### Fitting
what does it mean least-squares method and how it works					minimizes sum of the squares of the residuals
what is the difference between interpolation and fitting				interpolation finds points between known points 
											fitting finds a function that fits the all the points at once
